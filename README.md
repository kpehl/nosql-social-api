## Project Description

This project creates an API for a fictional social networking application, allowing users to share thoughts, have friend lists, and react to friends' thoughts. Users can also update a thought, delete a thought, delete a reaction, remove a friend, and delete their account, removing their associated thoughts and removing them from any friend lists they were on.

## Tools Used to Create This Project
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose

## Installation and Usage

If you would like to view the code and use the API on your own computer, follow the steps below:

* Clone the repository to your computer
* From the project directory command line, type `npm install` to install the dependencies for this project (express, and mongoose)
* Type `npm start` to start the server
* When you see the notification that the server is connected on localhost:3001, you can open your tool of choice to test out the routes. I used Insomnia Core.
* The routes are as follows:
    * Get all users: GET http://localhost:3001/api/users/
    * Get one user: GET http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userid
    * Create a user: POST http://localhost:3001/api/users/
    * Update a user: PUT http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userid
    * Delete a user: DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userid
    * Add a friend: POST http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userid/friends/:userid_of_friend
    * Delete a friend: DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userid/friends/:userid_of_friend
    * Get all thoughts: GET http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/
    * Get one thought: GET http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:thoughtid
    * Create a thought: POST http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/
    * Update a thought: PUT http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:thoughtid
    * Delete a thought: DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:thoughtid
    * Create a reaction: POST http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:thoughtid/reactions
    * Delete a reaction: DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:thoughtid/reactions/:reactionid

* To create a user, the JSON body should be of the form
```
{
  "username": "Gavin",
  "email": "gavin@gmail.com"
}
```
* To create a thought, the JSON body should be of the form
```
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...nitrogen turns from a gas into a liquid at -320 degrees F (-196 degrees C).",
  "username": "Gavin",
  "userId": "5fd10d3dc7d3c9f3d05a860c"
}
```
     * Where the userId is the one generated by your MongoDB instance

* A a reaction JSON body will appear as follows
```
{
  "reactionBody": "It's never too cold for iced coffee",
  "username": "Brian"
}
```
